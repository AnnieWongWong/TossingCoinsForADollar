# Tossing Coins For A Dollar

# Description

A game in which the dealer has 3 coins which are a quarter, a dime, and a nickel. When the game begins, the player’s starting balance is $0. During each round of the game, the dealer will toss the simulated coins simultaneously. When the coins are tossed, the values of the coins are added to the player’s balance if they land heads-up. For example, if the quarter lands heads-up, 25 cents is added to the player’s balance. Nothing is added to the player’s balance for coins that land tails-up. The game is over when the player’s balance reaches $1 or more. If the player’s balance is exactly $1, the player win the game. The player loses if the player’s balance exceeds $1.
